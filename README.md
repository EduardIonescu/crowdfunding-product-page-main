Users should be able to:

-   See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
-   See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
-   Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Sass
-   JavaScript
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   How to use modals

### Continued development

I want to further improve my skills at working with modals and custom inputs.

### Useful resources
